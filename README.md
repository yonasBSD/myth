## Introduction

**Myth** is a high-performance, cross-platform 3D rendering engine built with Rust and wgpu. It aims to provide ultimate rendering performance and a minimalist API design, delivering a seamless programming experience for developers.

> For complete quick-start tutorials, API guides, advanced rendering features, and underlying architecture design, please visit the **[Myth Engine Homepage](https://panxinmiao.github.io/myth/en)**.

> No environment configuration required—**[experience Myth Engine's rendering capabilities directly in your browser](https://panxinmiao.github.io/myth/gallery/)**.


## Core Features

* **Write Once, Run Anywhere:** Leveraging the power of `wgpu`, Myth can be coded once and run natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and seamlessly compiled to WASM to run in modern browsers (WebGPU).
* **Next-Generation Graphics Pipeline:**
    * Full support for Physically Based Rendering (PBR).
    * Efficient Clustered Forward Lighting.
    * A suite of advanced post-processing effects including Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI), Screen Space Reflections (SSR), and SSAO.
    * **Built-in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering support** for high-fidelity novel view synthesis.
* **Modern Render Graph Architecture:** The core utilizes a strict SSA (Static Single Assignment) [render graph architecture](https://panxinmiao.github.io/myth/en/architecture/render-graph), automatically handling complex VRAM reuse, pipeline barriers, and dependency synchronization.
* **Rich Productivity Ecosystem:** Complete glTF support, asynchronous asset loading, and native support for Python bindings to meet various workflow requirements.

## Quick Start

### Installation

In your Rust project, add Myth via Cargo:

```bash
cargo add myth-engine
```

### "Hello World"

Implement a rotating cube with a checkerboard texture in under 50 lines of code:

```rust
use myth::prelude::*;

struct MyApp;

impl AppHandler for MyApp {
    fn init(engine: &mut Engine, _: &dyn Window) -> Self {
        // 0. Create a scene
        let scene = engine.scene_manager.create_active();

        // 1. Create a cube mesh with a checkerboard texture
        let tex_handle = engine.assets.checkerboard(512, 64);
        let mesh_handle = scene.spawn_box(
            1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 
            PhongMaterial::new(Vec4::new(1.0, 0.76, 0.33, 1.0)).with_map(tex_handle),
            &engine.assets,
        );
        // 2. Set up the camera
        let cam_node_id = scene.add_camera(Camera::new_perspective(45.0, 1280.0 / 720.0, 0.1));
        scene.node(&cam_node_id).set_position(0.0, 0.0, 5.0).look_at(Vec3::ZERO);
        scene.active_camera = Some(cam_node_id);
        
        // 3. Add a light source
        scene.add_light(Light::new_directional(Vec3::ONE, 5.0));

        // 4. Set an update callback to rotate the cube
        scene.on_update(move |scene, _input, _dt| {
            if let Some(node) = scene.get_node_mut(mesh_handle) {
                let rot_y = Quat::from_rotation_y(0.02);
                let rot_x = Quat::from_rotation_x(0.01);
                node.transform.rotation = node.transform.rotation * rot_y * rot_x;
            }
        });
        Self {}
    }
}

fn main() -> myth::Result<()> {
    App::new().with_title("Myth-Engine Demo").run::<MyApp>()
}

```

### Environments & Examples

Myth provides a rich set of Examples for developers. Whether you want to run it in a local Native environment, compile it for the Web, or use Python bindings, we have prepared comprehensive guides.

> **[Read the complete Quick Start guide](https://panxinmiao.github.io/myth/en/guide/quick-start)** for detailed build instructions.

### Python Bindings

The Myth engine also provides Python bindings for rapid prototyping and scientific visualization.
For installation methods and examples, please refer to the [Python Bindings](https://panxinmiao.github.io/myth/en/guide/python).
