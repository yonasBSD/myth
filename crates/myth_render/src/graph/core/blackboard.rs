//! Graph Blackboard & Custom Pass Hooks
//!
//! The [`GraphBlackboard`] is a lightweight, pass-by-value **cursor** over
//! well-known resource slots from the current frame's render graph.  External
//! code (e.g. UI plugins) receives a copy, wires its passes, and returns an
//! updated copy — there is no shared mutable state.
//!
//! [`CustomPassHook`] is a builder-time callback that lets external code
//! inject arbitrary [`PassNode`]s into the graph at a chosen stage.

use super::types::{BufferNodeId, TextureNodeId};

/// Well-known resource slots published by the engine's graph builder.
///
/// This is a **value type** (`Copy + Clone`).  Hooks receive the blackboard
/// by value, modify the slots they care about, and return a fresh copy.
/// The Rust compiler enforces that every hook path returns a valid
/// blackboard — forgetting to do so is a compile-time error.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// | Slot | Semantic | Typical consumer |
/// |------|----------|------------------|
/// | `scene_color` | HDR scene colour buffer | Custom post-FX |
/// | `scene_depth` | Main depth buffer (reverse-Z) | Depth-aware FX |
/// | `scene_hiz` | Reverse-Z Hi-Z pyramid (max-depth mip chain) | Hierarchical screen-space ray tracing |
/// | `atmosphere_transmittance` | Atmosphere transmittance LUT | Custom lit composites |
/// | `atmosphere_bake_params` | Atmosphere bake uniform buffer | Custom lit composites |
/// | `surface_out` | Final swap-chain output | UI overlay |
