///
/// # Lifecycle (Eager Setup)
///
/// Resource topology and naming are declared **outside** the `PassNode`,
/// inside the closure passed to [`RenderGraph::add_pass`].  The node
/// itself only participates in two runtime phases:
///
/// 1. **`prepare`** — called after graph compilation and transient memory
///    allocation.  Assemble `BindGroup`s that reference RDG-managed
///    transient textures.
/// 2. **`execute`** — record GPU commands into the shared encoder.
///
/// # Lifetime Model
///
/// The lifetime parameter `'a` represents the duration of a single frame.
/// Concrete implementations may carry frame-scoped borrowed references
/// (e.g. `&'a wgpu::BindGroup`, `&'a [ShadowLightInstance]`) whose
/// lifetimes are tied to either:
///
/// - The [`FrameArena`](super::arena::FrameArena) that allocates the node.
/// - Persistent `Feature` state that outlives the frame.
///
/// Because all nodes are allocated on the arena and the arena is reset
/// at frame boundaries, **no `Drop` glue is required** — the arena
/// reclaims all memory in O(1) without running destructors.
