//! Application Framework Module
//!
//! This module provides the application lifecycle management and windowing integration.
//! It bridges the engine core with platform-specific window systems.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The app module follows a trait-based design:
//!
//! - [`Window`]: Platform-independent window abstraction
//! - [`AppHandler`]: User-implemented trait for application behavior
//!
//! The framework handles window creation, event loop processing, input translation,
//! and frame timing. Users only need to implement [`AppHandler`].

use crate::engine::{Engine, FrameState};
use crate::window::Window;

/// Trait for defining application behavior.
///
/// Implement this trait to create your application. The framework will call
/// these methods at appropriate times during the application lifecycle.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. [`init`](Self::init) - Called once when the window and renderer are ready
/// 2. [`update`](Self::update) - Called each frame before rendering
/// 3. [`render`](Self::render) - Called to render the frame or customize the frame graph
///
/// # Input Handling
///
/// Use `engine.input` to query input state in [`update`](Self::update).
/// This is the standard game development paradigm and works across all backends.
///
/// For advanced use cases that require raw platform events (e.g., integrating
/// an external UI framework like egui), use [`on_event`](Self::on_event).
/// The concrete event type depends on the backend; with winit it is
/// `winit::event::WindowEvent`. Downcast via `event.downcast_ref::<T>()`.
pub trait AppHandler: Sized + 'static {
    /// Initializes the application.
    ///
    /// Called once after the window is created and the renderer is initialized.
    /// Use this to set up your scene, load assets, and prepare the initial state.
    fn init(engine: &mut Engine, window: &dyn Window) -> Self;

    /// Handles raw platform events (advanced use only).
    ///
    /// Most applications should use `engine.input` in [`update`](Self::update) instead.
    ///
    /// When using the winit backend, `event` is `winit::event::WindowEvent`.
    /// Access it via `event.downcast_ref::<winit::event::WindowEvent>()`.
    ///
    /// Return `true` to consume the event (preventing default input processing),
    /// or `false` to allow normal engine input handling.

    /// Renders the current frame.
    ///
    /// Override this method when you need to customize the built-in frame graph.
    /// The common pattern is to call `engine.compose_frame()`, inject any custom
    /// passes via `FrameComposer::add_custom_pass(...)`, then finish with
    /// `composer.render()`.

    /// The default implementation renders the active scene with the built-in
    /// pipeline selected by the current `RenderPath`.

///
/// This handler does nothing but can be used to verify that
/// the engine initializes and runs correctly.
